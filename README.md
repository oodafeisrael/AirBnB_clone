This  project is called the AirBnB_clone - A console project developed by Israel Odafe. It is a command interpreter to manage the AirBnB objects. It is my first step towards building my first full web application. The command interpreter (the console) is a command-line interface where we can interact with the objects of our web application by entering commands and receiving output.
